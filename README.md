# Arraytool
This is a fork of [arraytool](https://github.com/zinka/arraytool) that seeks to improve the directory structure and make installable using setup.py. As a result of doing this, I also attempted to update to Python3 (basically by updating all of the print statements)

Many things may be broken and I make no guarantees. So far I've only somewhat tested `arraytool.planar`. If you try to import something and it breaks, just submit a bug report or a PR. :)

Happy coding.
